# Supatest

## Roadmap

1. Fetch schema data from supabase sql.
2. Auto data generation with LLM (chatgpt/llama2) might encounter problem with linking data across multiple table?
3. Optionally insert the fake data into user's db with tag (indicates it's fake)
4. Web based interface

## Next.js

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

### Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

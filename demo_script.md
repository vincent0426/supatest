Hey everyone, in this video, I'll be walking you through the functionality of our testing tool, SupaTest. This nifty tool is designed to generate fake data for your Supabase database, making it a breeze to test your custom applications.

First things first, you'll need to grab your Supabase API URL, Project API key, and an OpenAI API token for content generation. Just a heads up, everything happens right within your frontend browser. Your token stays put, so no worries there. And for those who are curious, the source code of our project is wide open on GitHub.

Once you've smoothly connected to your Supabase project, it's time to pick the target table. Simply enter the number of rows you want to generate and hit that trusty "Generate" button. Now, keep in mind that we're tapping into the magic of deep learning for data generation, so a little patience is needed.

As you can see, we've generated four columns that satisfy the target table's schema. But here's the kicker: what if some of that auto-generated data isn't quite up to par? No biggie! You're in control. Feel free to delete a row or tweak specific column values until they're just right.

And now, for the grand finale: you have the power to publish these results straight to your database. Watch as your database transforms from empty to brimming with data that's as realistic as can be. It's like giving your database a virtual makeover.

Our aim is simple: to empower developers with a hassle-free way to test their applications using data that mirrors the real world. This means you can focus on crafting outstanding products with ease. Thanks for tuning in, and here's to building better apps together!
